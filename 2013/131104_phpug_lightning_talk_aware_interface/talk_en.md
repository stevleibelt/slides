## AwareInterface, For What?

* dependency injection (also known as "interface injection" [0])
* declare dependencies via interfaces to easy up reading classes
* count dependencies of "MyClass" via "grep -r 'MyClassAwareInterface' source/"

---

## Dependency Injection? But There Are Other Types Also! [1]

### Constructor Injection 

* + object is in a ready state
* + object declares complexity up front
* +/- dependencies can not be swapped after instantiation 
* - can lead to cyclical dependencies 
* - dependencies are not polymorphic
* - there is a parameter per dependency
* - constructors are not part of the liskov substitutaion principle [5]

---

### Setter Injection

* + one injection point per dependency
* +/- its hard to distinguish between mandatory and optional dependencies
* - consumer has to be very honest to inject all dependencies

---

### Interface Injection

* + increase readability of class structure
* + one injection point per dependency
* + interface injection class to lead to a rule to distinguish between mandatory and optiona dependencies
* + could only consist of a "injectMyClass" method
* - could lead to a lot of consumed interfaces
* - consumer has to be very honest to inject all dependencies
